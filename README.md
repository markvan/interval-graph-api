# interval-graph-api
Uses Spring Boot to provide an API for 
my [interval graph](https://github.com/markvan/basic-interval-graph).

Don't get too excited yet, first I'm working through the 
[IntelliJ IDEA Spring Boot tutorial](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/your-first-spring-application.html), 
then I'll mutate that into an API that uses the interval graph package.

Yeah, yeah, this is not monorepo-like ðŸ˜œ. I may get around to that later.
